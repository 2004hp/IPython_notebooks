# IPython_notebooks
Set of iPython (Jupyter) notebooks about Python, Reactive Programming, Statistics, Finance, Data Bases, Optimization, Science in general, Machine Learning, Time-Series... and more

My favourites?

- **CS-Algo Problems**: It has more than 30 algorithmic problems about generators, list comprehension, map/reduce/filter problems, decorators... 

- **Doing Science with Python**: this one is huge, almost a book... and it is still 'work-in-progress' but it contains not only the basics about data containers, or basic algorithms, but also advance hash functions or some functional programming stuff
