# IPython_notebooks
[*Jesus Perez Colino*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesusperezcolino/)


Set of iPython (Jupyter) notebooks about things that I am interested like *Python*, *Statistics and Machine-Learning*, *Financial Engineering*, *Optimization*, *Science in general*, *Time-Series*... and more

My favourites?

- [**Algorithmic Problems in Python**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Problems%20in%20Python.ipynb): *(Computer Science)* It contains more than 60 algorithm problems about generators, list-comprehension, map/reduce/filter problems, decorators, regular expressions, simulations, classes... This is still a *work-in-progress*, but feel free to have a look, and enjoy.

- **Doing Science with Python**: *(Python programming)* this one is huge, almost a book... and it is still 'work-in-progress' but it contains not only the basics about data-containers, or basic algorithms, but also advance hash-functions and functional programming... but more specifically, or advanced in Python, maybe you find intriguing the notebooks about **Decorators, Closures and Wrappers** or the one about **Iterables, Generetors and Yield**, or related with **High Performance Computation (HPC)** check [HPC Cython vs. Multiprocessing](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/HPC%20Cython%20vs%20Multiprocessing.ipynb) out. Hope you like. 

- [**Doing Statistics with Python**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Doing%20Statistics%20with%20Python.ipynb): *(Statisitics and Machine Learning)* Another huge notebook, in fact, I wrote it thinking in a free eBook, but it is quite general (and basic) in terms of statistics.  
  - If you want to go deeper in **Statistics Techniques for Big Data**, maybe you should have a look into the **PCA for Big Data** or into **Regression Techniques for Big Data** notebooks, where I am using **PySpark** and **Apache Spark**. 
  - If you are working in **Machine Learning** with **Scikit-learn**, have a look into the SVM notebooks (e.g. [Cross Validation in SVM](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Cross-Validation%20in%20SVM.ipynb) or [Classification Metrics with SVM](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Classification%20Metrics%20with%20SVM.ipynb)) or, if you are interested in knowing how to store in **MongoDB** your input/output or model results, have a look to the code of [MongoDB, Numpy and Scikit-learn](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/MongoDB%2C%20Numpy%20and%20Scikit-learn.ipynb) notebook. 

- [**Two-Factor Model**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Two_Factor_Model-SimpleVersion.ipynb): *(Stochastic Modelling)* this one is more technical, from the mathematical point of view, but quite interesting if you are working in *commodities modelling, derivatives pricing*, or *risk-management*. This one is the simplest possible version, that made the equivalence between Black-76 and the Two-Factor Model for forward contracts. I will update it soon, with a  more object-oriented version. Stay tuned. If you want to have the full object-oriented version, with *Robust Calibration* of the SDE using *Semidefinite Programming* and unit-testing, contact me.

- ... and if you are interested in **Financial Engineering**, you will find interesting the notebooks about:

... pls, be my guest, and serve yourself. Have fun.
